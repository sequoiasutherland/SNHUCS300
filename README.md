# SNHUCS300

1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
This project focused on creating a program which could be used by faculty of a college to view and print courses and their associated info. The program loads a file which contains the course info, and allows the user to search for a specific course, then viewing its prerequisite courses, or print all of the courses in the system in alphanumeric order.

2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I chose to use a binary search tree for this project because of its runtime, and because of its ease of use when searching for ordered items. I set up the load function to load the data structure into the tree in alphanumeric order as the file was parsed, so that further printing of the courses would just take one in-order traversal.

3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I find YouTube to be a great resource when I am unable to figure out how to implement a new method or syntax. I find it much quicker to learn by viewing someone else use the method in action, and my comprehension increases rather than just reading text. 

4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I found the coursework on algorithms interesting, you have to truly get into an analytical mindset in order to build data structures and algorithms correctly, and correcting logic errors can be frustrating. That said, I appreciate what I learned and I look forward to being able to implement these data structures elsewhere in my development. 

5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I noticed that a lot of the code that was provided had great comments that made the code easy to read and I was able to quickly identify the areas which I needed to work on, and understand what the original developer was thinking when the code was written. This reinforced for me that maintaining good code is not only an endeavor of coding skill, but of proper documentation and explanation as well.
